* support textures
set a mode flag in the fragment shader that sets one of several states,
0) color from texture
1) color from color Array

setup a uniform for the texture.

* support quads and wireframe.
we cannot directly pass these calls to the gl context since we do not
know what we are supposed to be rendering. If we are rendering quads
we have to re-write the buffers as two triangles, one for each quad.
If we are rendering lines we have to pack the points in a different
order. We do not know what is to be rendeded untill drawArray is
called and we consult the polygon mode. So all the calls to
bindBuffer, setBufferData and set*Pointer need to be pushed into a
stack and dealt with when drawArray is called.

Alternatively, we could pre-process the JSON data and manipulate the
arrays beforehand?

Rendering lines and rendering filled faces requires different packings!
